# task1
This repository is made for Task1 assigned by Mr. Vimal Daga, where we had to use the concept of CGI and integrate it with command line of linux as we needed to use the other system to process the output via CGI 
and display it to the user via the browser screen.

This is a small task so the README file wont be descriptive and all the files used in the project are given above......
